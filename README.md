From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquery)

Created a simple pixle trail application using javascript.

Lessons learned:
	Javascript can be very error prone and not behave in expected 		ways.

	Javascript does a poor job of giving what type of error is 		being caused making print debugging very useful in finding 		syntax and logic errors.

	Implemented loops, conditionals, and nested functions to 		achieve expected behaviour.

	CSS interacts with HTML in a more preferable way when auto 		width margins are used rather than directly defining them.
